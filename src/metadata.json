  "abstract": "Many computer scientists discuss the downstream effects of artificial intelligence\u2014on labor markets, energy systems, and governance\u2014without using the formal tools that economists and political scientists have developed. I argue for a minimal interdisciplinary core for AI\u2011bound students: one course in macroeconomics (externalities, general equilibrium, and growth under technology shocks) and one in political institutions (electoral systems, veto\u2011player theory, and principal\u2013agent models). The goal is not to turn computer scientists into social scientists, but to equip the people building general\u2011purpose technologies to reason about the social systems in which their work is deployed. The piece outlines a concrete curricular template, two short analytic vignettes (energy and labor), and practical steps departments can take without increasing time\u2011to\u2011degree.",
