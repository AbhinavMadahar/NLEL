Subject: Viewpoint proposal — Teach AI to Think in Equilibria: A Minimal Interdisciplinary Core for Computer Scientists

Dear Editors (Prof. Odd Erik Gundersen and Prof. K. Brent Venable),

I would like to propose a Viewpoint/Essay for AI Magazine titled “Teach AI to Think in Equilibria: A Minimal Interdisciplinary Core for Computer Scientists.” The piece argues that AI‑focused CS curricula should require two social‑science courses—macroeconomics and political institutions—to improve safety‑relevant reasoning about AI’s downstream effects. It offers a concrete curricular template and two short analytic vignettes (energy and labor) to show how formal models change impact forecasts.

Scope and fit: The article is expository rather than technical, pitched to AI practitioners and educators, and sits squarely in AI education and governance—a recurring theme in recent AI Magazine issues.

Practical details: ≈1,350 words (expandable if desired), 6 references, no figures. The attached draft is exclusive to AI Magazine. A shorter personal note on May 2, 2025 motivated this expanded version; the submission is >60% new text.

I am happy to revise per your guidance (e.g., length, department, or adding sidebars/assignments). I include a 70‑word author bio below.

Thank you for considering the proposal.

Best regards,
Abhinav Madahar (अभਿਨव ਮਦਾਹਰ)

Short bio (70 words)
Abhinav Madahar (ਅਭਿਨਵ ਮਦਾਹਰ) is an independent computer scientist whose research advances the reasoning capabilities of frontier AI systems. He designs architectures that structure multi‑step reasoning so language‑model agents can solve problems beyond a single model’s capacity—under both human‑scale constraints (e.g., airline network planning) and humanity‑scale initiatives (e.g., WHO‑backed grand challenges). He also contributes to discourse on artificial‑intelligence law and policy.
