Abhinav Madahar (ਅਭਿਨਵ ਮਦਾਹਰ) is an independent computer scientist whose research advances the reasoning capabilities of frontier AI systems. He designs architectures that structure multi‑step reasoning so language‑model agents can solve problems beyond a single model’s capacity—under both human‑scale constraints (e.g., airline network planning) and humanity‑scale initiatives (e.g., WHO‑backed grand challenges). He also contributes to discourse on artificial‑intelligence law and policy.
